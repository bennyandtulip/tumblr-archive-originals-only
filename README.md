## Background

After the "Great Tumblr NSFW Purge of 2018", we exported and downloaded our
backup.

Since then, We've been thinking about giving [Sharesome][sharesome] a try, and
they are offering an "Import Tumblr Blog" function which will take your Tumblr
archive ZIP file and import it.

However, our archive includes all of our reblogged content that we don't
actually own, and we don't really feel comfortable uploading other people's
content to another platform without their consent.

This tool reads our Tumblr archive, and filters it down to only our original
posts, and creates a new archive for us to upload to [Sharesome][sharesome].
